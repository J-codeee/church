## User Registration (Hidden)

The signup button is hidden by default for security. To access user registration:

2. At the bottom of the login form, you'll see dots (`‚Ä¢‚Ä¢`)
3. **Double-click** on these dots
4. This will switch to the registration form

### To Hide Signup Access Again:
The signup access is automatically hidden and only accessible through the double-click method described above.

## Security Features

2. Select "Sign Out" from the dropdown menu

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't see the Admin Login button"
- Make sure you're **triple-clicking quickly** on the logo
- Try again - you have multiple attempts
- The button appears for 10 seconds, then hides automatically

### "Can't access signup form"
- Open the login form first
- Look for the dots (`‚Ä¢‚Ä¢`) at the bottom
- **Double-click** (not single click) on the dots

### "Forgot admin password"
- Contact the website developer
- Admin passwords are securely stored and cannot be easily recovered

## Best Practices

1. **Always logout** when finished with admin tasks
2. **Don't share** the triple-click method with unauthorized users
3. **Use strong passwords** for admin accounts
4. **Regular backup** your content before major changes
